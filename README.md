# Travel App

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

Note: You can get an API KEY here > `https://api.openweathermap.org/`

## Instructions

### Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Start project

```
node server.js
```

Then, go to `localhost:8888`

---

This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.
